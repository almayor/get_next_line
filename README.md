# get\_next\_line

*This project is part of the official curriculum at [School 42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(school)).*

## Overview


* [Official instructions](docs/subjects/get_next_line.en.pdf)
* The aim of this project is to make you code a function that returns a line ending with a newline, read from a file descriptor.
* As per instructions, the project is realised using `libft` compiled during a previous [project](http://github.com/almayor/libft).
* Documentation ([html](https://rawcdn.githack.com/almayor/get_next_line/master/docs/documentation-html/get__next__line_8h.html), [pdf](docs/documentation.pdf)) generated with [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl).
* The project is consistent with the [Norme](docs/subjects/norme.en.pdf), the code standard accepted at *School 42*.
* This project has been tested with [Moulitest](https://github.com/yyang42/moulitest). 

## Acknowledgements

My code has been motivated by a similar [project](https://github.com/520luigi/Get_Next_Line/blob/master/get_next_line.c), realised by [Luigi](https://github.com/520luigi). My thanks go to him, as well as to [yyang42](https://github.com/yyang42) for making Moulitest freely available online. As always, I am also grateful to to the entire team behind School 42 and its [Moscow branch](https://21-school.ru
) and my fellow students for productive discussions.
